# Review Sections (11 sections, after scope and mode are agreed)

After each section: **STOP.** One question per issue. Do NOT batch. Recommend + WHY. If no issues or the fix is obvious, state what you'll do and move on — don't waste a question. Do NOT proceed until the user responds.

## Section 1: Architecture Review
Evaluate and diagram:
- Overall system design and component boundaries. Draw the dependency graph.
- Data flow — all four paths. For every new data flow, ASCII diagram the:
    - Happy path (data flows correctly)
    - Nil path (input is nil/missing — what happens?)
    - Empty path (input is present but empty/zero-length — what happens?)
    - Error path (upstream call fails — what happens?)
- State machines. ASCII diagram for every new stateful object. Include impossible/invalid transitions and what prevents them.
- Coupling concerns. Which components are now coupled that weren't before? Is that coupling justified? Draw the before/after dependency graph.
- Scaling characteristics. What breaks first under 10x load? Under 100x?
- Single points of failure. Map them.
- Security architecture. Auth boundaries, data access patterns, API surfaces. For each new endpoint or data mutation: who can call it, what do they get, what can they change?
- Production failure scenarios. For each new integration point, describe one realistic production failure (timeout, cascade, data corruption, auth failure) and whether the plan accounts for it.
- Rollback posture. If this ships and immediately breaks, what's the rollback procedure? Git revert? Feature flag? DB migration rollback? How long?

**EXPANSION and SELECTIVE EXPANSION additions:**
- What would make this architecture beautiful? Not just correct — elegant. Is there a design that would make a new engineer joining in 6 months say "oh, that's clever and obvious at the same time"?
- What infrastructure would make this feature a platform that other features can build on?

**SELECTIVE EXPANSION:** If any accepted cherry-picks from Step 0D affect the architecture, evaluate their architectural fit here. Flag any that create coupling concerns or don't integrate cleanly — this is a chance to revisit the decision with new information.

Required ASCII diagram: full system architecture showing new components and their relationships to existing ones.

## Section 2: Error & Rescue Map
This is the section that catches silent failures. It is not optional.
For every new method, service, or codepath that can fail, fill in this table:
```
  METHOD/CODEPATH          | WHAT CAN GO WRONG           | EXCEPTION CLASS
  -------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------
  ExampleService#call      | API timeout                 | TimeoutError
                           | API returns 429             | RateLimitError
                           | API returns malformed JSON  | JSONParseError
                           | DB connection pool exhausted| ConnectionPoolExhausted
                           | Record not found            | RecordNotFound
  -------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------

  EXCEPTION CLASS              | RESCUED?  | RESCUE ACTION          | USER SEES
  -----------------------------|-----------|------------------------|------------------
  TimeoutError                 | Y         | Retry 2x, then raise   | "Service temporarily unavailable"
  RateLimitError               | Y         | Backoff + retry         | Nothing (transparent)
  JSONParseError               | N ← GAP   | —                      | 500 error ← BAD
  ConnectionPoolExhausted      | N ← GAP   | —                      | 500 error ← BAD
  RecordNotFound               | Y         | Return nil, log warning | "Not found" message
```
Rules for this section:
- Catch-all error handling (`rescue StandardError`, `catch (Exception e)`, `except Exception`) is ALWAYS a smell. Name the specific exceptions.
- Catching an error with only a generic log message is insufficient. Log the full context: what was being attempted, with what arguments, for what user/request.
- Every rescued error must either: retry with backoff, degrade gracefully with a user-visible message, or re-raise with added context. "Swallow and continue" is almost never acceptable.
- For each GAP (unrescued error that should be rescued): specify the rescue action and what the user should see.
- For LLM/AI service calls specifically: what happens when the response is malformed? When it's empty? When it hallucinates invalid JSON? When the model returns a refusal? Each of these is a distinct failure mode.

## Section 3: Security & Threat Model
Security is not a sub-bullet of architecture. It gets its own section.
Evaluate:
- Attack surface expansion. What new attack vectors does this plan introduce? New endpoints, new params, new file paths, new background jobs?
- Input validation. For every new user input: is it validated, sanitized, and rejected loudly on failure? What happens with: nil, empty string, string when integer expected, string exceeding max length, unicode edge cases, HTML/script injection attempts?
- Authorization. For every new data access: is it scoped to the right user/role? Is there a direct object reference vulnerability? Can user A access user B's data by manipulating IDs?
- Secrets and credentials. New secrets? In env vars, not hardcoded? Rotatable?
- Dependency risk. New gems/npm packages? Security track record?
- Data classification. PII, payment data, credentials? Handling consistent with existing patterns?
- Injection vectors. SQL, command, template, LLM prompt injection — check all.
- Audit logging. For sensitive operations: is there an audit trail?

For each finding: threat, likelihood (High/Med/Low), impact (High/Med/Low), and whether the plan mitigates it.

## Section 4: Data Flow & Interaction Edge Cases
This section traces data through the system and interactions through the UI with adversarial thoroughness.

**Data Flow Tracing:** For every new data flow, produce an ASCII diagram showing:
```
  INPUT ──▶ VALIDATION ──▶ TRANSFORM ──▶ PERSIST ──▶ OUTPUT
    │            │              │            │           │
    ▼            ▼              ▼            ▼           ▼
  [nil?]    [invalid?]    [exception?]  [conflict?]  [stale?]
  [empty?]  [too long?]   [timeout?]    [dup key?]   [partial?]
  [wrong    [wrong type?] [OOM?]        [locked?]    [encoding?]
   type?]
```
For each node: what happens on each shadow path? Is it tested?

**Interaction Edge Cases:** For every new user-visible interaction, evaluate:
```
  INTERACTION          | EDGE CASE              | HANDLED? | HOW?
  ---------------------|------------------------|----------|--------
  Form submission      | Double-click submit    | ?        |
                       | Submit with stale CSRF | ?        |
                       | Submit during deploy   | ?        |
  Async operation      | User navigates away    | ?        |
                       | Operation times out    | ?        |
                       | Retry while in-flight  | ?        |
  List/table view      | Zero results           | ?        |
                       | 10,000 results         | ?        |
                       | Results change mid-page| ?        |
  Background job       | Job fails after 3 of   | ?        |
                       | 10 items processed     |          |
                       | Job runs twice (dup)   | ?        |
                       | Queue backs up 2 hours | ?        |
```
Flag any unhandled edge case as a gap. For each gap, specify the fix.

## Section 5: Code Quality Review
Evaluate:
- Code organization and module structure. Does new code fit existing patterns? If it deviates, is there a reason?
- DRY violations. Be aggressive. If the same logic exists elsewhere, flag it and reference the file and line.
- Naming quality. Are new classes, methods, and variables named for what they do, not how they do it?
- Error handling patterns. (Cross-reference with Section 2 — this section reviews the patterns; Section 2 maps the specifics.)
- Missing edge cases. List explicitly: "What happens when X is nil?" "When the API returns 429?" etc.
- Over-engineering check. Any new abstraction solving a problem that doesn't exist yet?
- Under-engineering check. Anything fragile, assuming happy path only, or missing obvious defensive checks?
- Cyclomatic complexity. Flag any new method that branches more than 5 times. Propose a refactor.

## Section 6: Test Review
Make a complete diagram of every new thing this plan introduces:
```
  NEW UX FLOWS:
    [list each new user-visible interaction]

  NEW DATA FLOWS:
    [list each new path data takes through the system]

  NEW CODEPATHS:
    [list each new branch, condition, or execution path]

  NEW BACKGROUND JOBS / ASYNC WORK:
    [list each]

  NEW INTEGRATIONS / EXTERNAL CALLS:
    [list each]

  NEW ERROR/RESCUE PATHS:
    [list each — cross-reference Section 2]
```
For each item in the diagram:
- What type of test covers it? (Unit / Integration / System / E2E)
- Does a test for it exist in the plan? If not, write the test spec header.
- What is the happy path test?
- What is the failure path test? (Be specific — which failure?)
- What is the edge case test? (nil, empty, boundary values, concurrent access)

Test ambition check (all modes): For each new feature, answer:
- What's the test that would make you confident shipping at 2am on a Friday?
- What's the test a hostile QA engineer would write to break this?
- What's the chaos test?

Test pyramid check: Many unit, fewer integration, few E2E? Or inverted?
Flakiness risk: Flag any test depending on time, randomness, external services, or ordering.
Load/stress test requirements: For any new codepath called frequently or processing significant data.

For LLM/prompt changes: Check the project instructions file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) for the "Prompt/LLM changes" file patterns. If this plan touches ANY of those patterns, state which eval suites must be run, which cases should be added, and what baselines to compare against.

## Section 7: Performance Review
Evaluate:
- N+1 queries. For every new ActiveRecord association traversal: is there an includes/preload?
- Memory usage. For every new data structure: what's the maximum size in production?
- Database indexes. For every new query: is there an index?
- Caching opportunities. For every expensive computation or external call: should it be cached?
- Background job sizing. For every new job: worst-case payload, runtime, retry behavior?
- Slow paths. Top 3 slowest new codepaths and estimated p99 latency.
- Connection pool pressure. New DB connections, Redis connections, HTTP connections?

## Section 8: Observability & Debuggability Review
New systems break. This section ensures you can see why.
Evaluate:
- Logging. For every new codepath: structured log lines at entry, exit, and each significant branch?
- Metrics. For every new feature: what metric tells you it's working? What tells you it's broken?
- Tracing. For new cross-service or cross-job flows: trace IDs propagated?
- Alerting. What new alerts should exist?
- Dashboards. What new dashboard panels do you want on day 1?
- Debuggability. If a bug is reported 3 weeks post-ship, can you reconstruct what happened from logs alone?
- Admin tooling. New operational tasks that need admin UI or rake tasks?
- Runbooks. For each new failure mode: what's the operational response?

**EXPANSION and SELECTIVE EXPANSION addition:**
- What observability would make this feature a joy to operate? (For SELECTIVE EXPANSION, include observability for any accepted cherry-picks.)

## Section 9: Deployment & Rollout Review
Evaluate:
- Migration safety. For every new DB migration: backward-compatible? Zero-downtime? Table locks?
- Feature flags. Should any part be behind a feature flag?
- Rollout order. Correct sequence: migrate first, deploy second?
- Rollback plan. Explicit step-by-step.
- Deploy-time risk window. Old code and new code running simultaneously — what breaks?
- Environment parity. Tested in staging?
- Post-deploy verification checklist. First 5 minutes? First hour?
- Smoke tests. What automated checks should run immediately post-deploy?

**EXPANSION and SELECTIVE EXPANSION addition:**
- What deploy infrastructure would make shipping this feature routine? (For SELECTIVE EXPANSION, assess whether accepted cherry-picks change the deployment risk profile.)

## Section 10: Long-Term Trajectory Review
Evaluate:
- Technical debt introduced. Code debt, operational debt, testing debt, documentation debt.
- Path dependency. Does this make future changes harder?
- Knowledge concentration. Documentation sufficient for a new engineer?
- Reversibility. Rate 1-5: 1 = one-way door, 5 = easily reversible.
- Ecosystem fit. Aligns with Rails/JS ecosystem direction?
- The 1-year question. Read this plan as a new engineer in 12 months — obvious?

**EXPANSION and SELECTIVE EXPANSION additions:**
- What comes after this ships? Phase 2? Phase 3? Does the architecture support that trajectory?
- Platform potential. Does this create capabilities other features can leverage?
- (SELECTIVE EXPANSION only) Retrospective: Were the right cherry-picks accepted? Did any rejected expansions turn out to be load-bearing for the accepted ones?

## Section 11: Design & UX Review (skip if no UI scope detected)
The CEO calling in the designer. Not a pixel-level audit — that's the `design` skill's review-plan and audit modes. This is ensuring the plan has design intentionality.

Evaluate:
- Information architecture — what does the user see first, second, third?
- Interaction state coverage map:
  FEATURE | LOADING | EMPTY | ERROR | SUCCESS | PARTIAL
- User journey coherence — storyboard the emotional arc
- AI slop risk — does the plan describe generic UI patterns?
- DESIGN.md alignment — does the plan match the stated design system?
- Responsive intention — is mobile mentioned or afterthought?
- Accessibility basics — keyboard nav, screen readers, contrast, touch targets

**EXPANSION and SELECTIVE EXPANSION additions:**
- What would make this UI feel *inevitable*?
- What 30-minute UI touches would make users think "oh nice, they thought of that"?

Required ASCII diagram: user flow showing screens/states and transitions.

If this plan has significant UI scope, recommend: "Consider running the `design` skill's review-plan mode for a deep design review of this plan before implementation."
